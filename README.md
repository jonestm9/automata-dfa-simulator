# Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) Simulator 

To run, make sure you have Python installed.

Then, run

```
python3 dfa_sim.py
```

in your terminal when in the repo's directory.

Once running, you'll be prompted to input your DFA's alphabet, states, start state, accepting states, and transitions.
Then, you'll be prompted to enter strings that your DFA will either accept or reject as being recognized in the language.

To run the testing suite, run 
```
python3 testing.py
```
